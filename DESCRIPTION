Description: Provides functions to compute the log response ratio (LRR) and associated
    confidence intervals for treatment-control experiments, with optional
    grouping support. The package also calculates standardized effect sizes,
    including Cohen's d and Hedges' g. Missing, undefined, or non-finite values
    are safely excluded to ensure robust estimation across experimental units
    and groups.
